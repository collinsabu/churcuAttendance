## üåü Features

### Attendance Form
The Church Attendance Application includes an attendance form where users can submit information regarding weekly church activities. Key functionalities include:

- **Data Submission:** Information entered into the attendance form is sent to a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas. This ensures efficient storage and retrieval of attendance records.
- **API Integration:** The submitted data is fetched via an API endpoint using the GET method. The data is then mapped and displayed on the homepage, allowing for easy viewing and management.

### CRUD Operations
The application demonstrates full CRUD functionality:

- **Create:** Users can add new attendance records via the attendance form.
- **Read:** All attendance records are fetched from the MongoDB database and displayed on the homepage.
- **Update:** Each attendance record can be edited directly from the homepage, allowing users to make changes as needed.
- **Delete:** Records can be deleted, removing them from both the homepage display and the database.

### Authentication
The application uses **NextAuth** for secure user authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access and manage the church‚Äôs attendance records.

- **Secure Access:** Authentication is required to access the CRUD operations, ensuring that data management is restricted to authorized personnel.
- **User Management:** Users can log in and out securely, with their session data managed efficiently.
